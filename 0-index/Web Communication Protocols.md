## ðŸ§  Main idea

Web communication protocols define the rules and standards that allow systems to exchange information over the internet. They are essential for enabling client-server communication and interaction between distributed systems.

---

## ðŸ§© Context

These protocols operate primarily over the application layer of the internet protocol stack and are used to transmit data in formats suitable for the web. Examples include request/response models (like HTTP and REST), messaging (SOAP), and real-time bidirectional communication (WebSocket).

Understanding these protocols is crucial for building and maintaining web-based systems, APIs, and networked services.
