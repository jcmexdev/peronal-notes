# YAGNI You Aren’t Gonna Need It

## Keywords
- #design-principle

## Notes
This design principle is about not build something that won't be needed for example, imagine that you are building a todo app, and you requirements only includes a title for a simple task but you add the following fields:
- due dates
- timestamps
- priority

these attributes aren't needed and you should focus only in real and well justified requirements.


## Questions?
- [ ] With techniques can we use to avoid it?
	- [ ] Add new features only when it are required
	- [ ] Puts clarity before flexibility

## Summary

> [!important]
> Being focus in real requirements allow us to don't overkill, prevent technical debt, reduce maintenance effort. _Don’t try to predict the future. Wait until it arrives._
